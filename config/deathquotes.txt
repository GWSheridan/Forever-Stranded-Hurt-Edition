I didn't know you could bend like that.
I didn't like that one bit. Not one tiny bit.
I eat death for lunch! Could I order a pizza instead?
I feel that the current plan needs adjusted in the last part here.

I reject reality, and substitute Minecraft.
I saw nothing, not a thing.
I see dead people. Oh, Its you again

I try to be positive. (emphasis on try)
I view this as a technical problem.
I want my mommy!
I was just thinking' Give me a minute, ok?
I was just training my dog to play dead.
I will live on in the pixels!
I wonder what else I can do while I'm down here?
I wouldn't worry about dying if I were you, you seem to have more problems with living.

I'm just going to shake it off. Shake it off.
I'm not saying that I'm keeping track of how many times you die, but...
I'm not surprised you're dead. I'm just surprised you made it this far.
I'm so tired of this part.
I've fallen and I can't get up
I've heard Florida is beautiful this time of year.

If I only had...
If you are dead, please raise your hand.
If you're killed in the matrix, you die here.

LEROY JENKINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Let me check my list... Nope. This wasn't on it.

Life hurts a lot more than death.
Life is pleasant. Death is peaceful. It is the transition that is troublesome.

List: Need aspirin.
Living good. Dying bad. Ya, that was it.

The End
The force was not with this one.
The ground hath come up swiftly from underneath to smite me... It smote HARD!
The point of Minecraft is to stay alive!
The power of Grazed skull!
There are 2 types of people. Living and dead.
There are moments when...
There are places you shouldn't stand.
There he goes again...

This is getting old.
This never happens to me!
This one is pushing up daisies!
Time to call 1-800-FLOWERS
Time to play Name That Dead Guy!

Timeout!
To be or not to be? Not! *sigh*
To die or not to die? Thus is Minecraft.
Try, and Try again.
Ug!

Waaaa! Leave me alone!
Wanted, Dead or Alive. Oops. Whatever.
Watch that first step there. Its a Dussey!
Welcome to hell!! Oh, ya, um, welcome to Minecraft.

Weren't we just here?
What a way to go...
What just happened?!?
What? WHAT? Tell me that didn't just happen.
What?!?!
Whatever...
Whats heartless, horizontal, and hilarious? You!
Whats up? Oh. You aren't.
Wheee! Lets do it again!
When does the hurting stop?
When you are at the bottom, there is only one way to go.
Who ever said 'No Pain No Gain' needs their butt kicked.
Who's dead? This guy!
Whoopsie!
Why me?
Why? Did I do it wrong?
Why? WHY?
With Hell's last breath I spit at thee!
Ya, but when I was a kid I could...
Ya, my bed is much more comfortable than here.
Yea, yea. I know, you're coming back to avenge your death.
You are doing it wrong!
You are drop dead funny!
You are not supposed to die!
You aren't paranoid, if they really are trying to kill you.
You can only fail if you stop trying.
You died so many times, you don't deserve a quote.
You had one task Billy... One task...
You have got to be kidding?
You have no hearts left.
You just had to do it! Didn't you?
You killed my brother! Prepare to die! What? Already dead? No fair!
You lost the game!
You should see the other guy!
You want me to re-enlist?
You will be missed. And now for moment of silence... Ok, we are done.
You've got something on your shirt. THE PLANET!
